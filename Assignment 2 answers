Software engineering is a disciplined approach to the development, operation, maintenance, and retirement of software. It involves applying engineering principles and practices to create reliable, efficient, and high-quality software systems. The field encompasses a wide range of activities including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and project management. The goal is to deliver software that meets user needs and operates efficiently in a predictable and maintainable manner.
Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It focuses on applying engineering principles to software creation, ensuring that the software is reliable, efficient, and scalable. The process involves the systematic application of scientific and mathematical principles to achieve cost-effective solutions to software problems. Software Engineering: Encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis to maintenance. It involves systematic planning, design, testing, and maintenance.Traditional Programming: Primarily focuses on writing code to solve specific problems. It does not typically involve planning, design, or maintenance in a structured manner.The SDLC is a framework that defines the processes involved in software development, from initial planning to deployment and maintenance. It ensures that software meets the required standards and fulfills user needs. Key phases in SDLC include planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance
